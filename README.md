# rogue

This is a sample roguelike game I'm creating straight from a tutorial:

http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/

The idea is to familiarize myself with python3 and get used to coding after taking a few classes with it.

To run the game so far, ensure pip has installed packages in `requirements.txt` and run `main.py` with your python3 interpreter. So far it's not terribly exciting, sure, but it's been fun!

Commands:

 * Numpad to move around - attack by moving towards the enemy
 * ESC to exit the game
 * `g` to pick up item
 * `c` to see your character sheet
 * `>` to go down a level (no going back up yet)
 * `i` to access inventory, then the letter to use the item
 * `d` to drop an item
 * `v` to view the message log
