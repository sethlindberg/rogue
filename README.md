# rogue

This is a sample roguelike game I'm creating straight from a tutorial:

The idea is to familiarize myself with python3 and get used to coding after taking a few classes with it.

To run the game so far, ensure pip has installed packages in `requirements.txt` and run `main.py` with your python3 interpreter. So far it's not terribly exciting, sure, but it's been fun!
